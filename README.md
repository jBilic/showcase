# Showcase
This is a showcase repository for __some of my work__ in field of electronics design.
Majority of my work is related to my private projects and experiments. 
On the professional side, by far the largest and most complex project is one called __Wireless IO__. 
Unfortunately I cannot disclose any details publicly - that's why I've only uploaded photos of final designs.

If you want to know more details, feel free to contact me.

## ESP32
As you might have concluded by now, I do a lot of my projects with ESP32.
Main reason being that majority of my projects are IoT prototypes and I need an MCU with network connectivitiy.
ESP is therefore a perfect candidate with a huge range of SoC's, modules, examples etc.

For quick and dirty projects I use Arduino IDE, but recently I've started to use ESP-IDF.
Projects I've done up to this pooint have involved features like:
* sensor data reading (temperature, humiditiy, pressure, light etc.)
* radio communication 
* Bluetooth
* motion detection
* ESP hosted servers and websites
* LoRa
* light control (LED's)
* power control 
* RTOS
* Power modes

Projects involved were a IoT Coffee Machine, Home Security System, Remote Watering station etc.

## STM32
I haven't done a lot of work on STM products. As part of my professional work I do work with them, but this is mainly debugging, flashing etc.
Recently I've acquired and STM Discovery board but haven't done a lot other than playing with some RTOS scheduling, running examples etc.
