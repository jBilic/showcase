# Showcase
## This is a showcase repository of my work in field of PCB design.
Majority of my work is related to my private projects and experiments. 
On the professional side, by far the largest and most complex project is one called __Wireless IO__. 
Unfortunately I cannot disclose any details publicly - that's why I've only uploaded photos of final designs.

If you want to know more details, feel free to contact me.
